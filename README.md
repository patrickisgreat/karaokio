### Backend (Next.js API Routes)
```
/api/queue/add          # Add song to queue
/api/queue              # Get current state  
/api/queue/[id]/start   # Start singing
/api/upload             # Upload audio files
/api/songs/search       # Search music databases
```

### Processing Pipeline
```
User Request → Song Search → Audio Acquisition → 
Vocal Separation → Lyrics Sync → Video Generation → Ready to Sing
```

2. Background job processes audio with Demucs/Spleeter
3. Lyrics fetched and synchronized with timestamps  
4. Video generated with animated background + lyrics
5. Song marked "ready" in queue
6. User clicks "Start Singing" → Full-screen player
```
